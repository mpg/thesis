Warning: page and line numbers at the start of a line (before the colon) are
references to the original list; page and line numbers in the replies (after
the colon), however, refer to the *new* version of the manuscript!

Also, the revised version includes corrections and improvments suggested by
the other reviewer too.

p10 l-4: see p12 l1 to l5.

p11 l11: done.

p11 l-1: see p12 l3.

p16 l-11: added a definition (now p17 l19).

p16 l-3: Oops, you're right, using \inf now. I adapted the proofs of lemme
3.4.1 and lemme 4.1.3; I believe no other proofs are impacted.

p17 l5: it is. Now stated explicitly (p17 l-1)

p17 l12: done (p18 l7)

p19 l-1: added a reference (the line before prop 1.6.3, p20 now)

p21 l18: it is, fixed the notation (p22 l18 now)

p22 l12: the constants are computed just below (added a sentence about that
hoping to make it clearer, now p23 l11).

p25 l8: I tend to disagree. Theorem 2.1.1 is trivial if \eps \ge 1, as
observed on p26 l7-9. Corollaires 2.7.6 and 2.7.9 are correct for any \eps
since Theorem 2.1.1 is. Or did I miss something?
(By the way, I removed the hypothesis \eps < 1 in corollaire 2.7.9 for
consistency.)

p25 l10: in general, x_i means any point, while e_i means the points
contradicting theorem 2.1.1 that are fixed from section 2.2 to section 2.6
included, to distinguish them from random points denoted by x_i (eg at the
beginning of section 2.2.5).

p25 l16: the subscript V is meant as a reference to Vojta (to be really
nitpicky, it's an upright V, while the variety is an italic V). Originally the
idea was to have the same letters with subscript M for Mumford's inequality.
I restored this idea on page 2, so maybe it makes a little bit more sense now.

p30 l5: fixed (p32 l5)

p32 l-4: yes, now stated explicitly (p34 l-4)

p33 l7: right, changed to "sous-variété" (p35 l7)

p33 l17: reference added (p35 l17)

p38 l9: C' is a shorcut for C'_D; added a reminder (p40 l7)
stated r = \deg R too (p40 l12)

p40, eq 2.27: changed "la forme" to "la famille de formes" just before the
equation, to make it clear(er) it is an equality of vectors (whose components
are polynomials) (p42 eq 2.27)

p41 l5: changed that to "qui sera choisi assez grand" (p43 l5)

p42 l5: right, linearity is used at the middle of the proof actually. I
changed the proof to make it explicit (p44 l11 to l18).

p45 l7: reference added (p46 l17), changed Hilbert to Hibert-Samuel too (3x)

p47 l8-10: right, fixed (p49 l14-16)

p48 l1: fixed (p50 l7)

p48 l6: I chose to add a footnote here (p50 l12) and a reminder (again as a
footnote, refering to the first footnote) when the first forward reference is
made in section 2.4.2 (p66, ref to 2.65) and section 2.5 (p73, ref to 2.62)

p49 l9: right (p51 l14)

p53 l-6 and -5: removed them, there presence was a mistake (p55 l-1 & l-2)

p57 l1: that's not what I really meant, corrected (p59 l1-2)

p59 l5: done (p61 l5)

p59 l-10: note means footnote here; removed the superflous instance (p61 l-10)

p61 l1: reference added (p62 l-2)

p64 l11: I do think so, it's where the various r_i disappeared (p66 l11)

p71 l4: made the first inaquality strict (p72 l-6)

p79 l20 & l21: added an explicit quantification (p81 l11)
It would be true for x \in P^n, but the notation make sense only
for x \in A, since \Theta and \Theta' are embedings of A.

p80 l11&12: done (p82 l3&4)

p85 l-14: done (p87 l11)

p89 l15: added the factor 2 which was missing indeed (p91 l6)
This doesn't have any impact later since the the inequality chain starting
with c_{3, \Theta'} 6 lines below already uses 3dn to account for this term
and the dn appearing after h_{...}(F).

p90 l-6: I think it is enough since P is homogeneous. Added a reference for
that. (p92 l-13)

p96 l-8: done (p98 l-5)

p96 l-1: done (p99 l3)

p97 l-13: fixed (p100 l-7)

p97 l-11: fixed by adapting the result (which is meant to be used with the
normalized height in (3.16)) (p100 l-5)

p97 l-7 & l-4: done (p101 l4 & l6)

p102 l14: XXX

p102 l12&13: done (p105 l1)

p102 l-2: ok

p103 l9: removed this sentence, which belonged to a previous version of the
lemma (p105 l-7)

p113 l1: of course (p114 l-2)

p114 l8: you're right, in general it doesn't. I modified these paragraphs
quite extensively (more precisely, almost everything from corollaire 4.1.4 to
the proof of corollaire 4.1.6 (previously 4.1.5) has been rewritten, with a
new scolie): this should cover the 2 next comments too.

p114 l9: right, fixed

p115 l-5: an argument was missing from my proof, however in the case
considered here, I believe the result was correct, see the corrected argument.

p117 l18: sure (p119 l-6)

p117 l-2: right (p120 l7)

p120 l12: right (p122 l-8)

p123 l-1: yes, that's what I meant (p126 l9)

p130 l2: done (p132 l12)

p132: fixed (p134)
