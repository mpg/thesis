Warning: page and line numbers at the start of a line (before the colon) are
references to the original list; page and line numbers in the replies (after
the colon), however, refer to the *new* version of the manuscript!

Also, the revised version includes corrections and improvments suggested by
the other reviewer too.

p10 l-4: see p12 l1 to l5.

p11 l11: done.

p11 l-1: see p12 l3.

p16 l-11: added a definition (now p17 l19).

p16 l-3: Oops, you're right, using \inf now. I adapted the proofs of lemme
3.4.1 and lemme 4.1.3; I believe no other proofs are impacted.

p17 l5: it is. Now stated explicitly (p17 l-1)

p17 l12: done (p18 l7)

p19 l-1: added a reference (the line before prop 1.6.3, p20 now)

p21 l18: it is, fixed the notation (p22 l18 now)

p22 l12: the constants are computed just below (added a sentence about that
hoping to make it clearer, now p23 l11).

p25 l8: I tend to disagree. Theorem 2.1.1 is trivial if \eps \ge 1, as
observed on p26 l7-9. Corollaires 2.7.6 and 2.7.9 are correct for any \eps
since Theorem 2.1.1 is. Or did I miss something?
(By the way, I removed the hypothesis \eps < 1 in corollaire 2.7.9 for
consistency.)

p25 l10: in general, x_i means any point, while e_i means the points
contradicting theorem 2.1.1 that are fixed from section 2.2 to section 2.6
included, to distinguish them from random points denoted by x_i (eg at the
beginning of section 2.2.5).

p25 l16: the subscript V is meant as a reference to Vojta (to be really
nitpicky, it's an upright V, while the variety is an italic V). Originally the
idea was to have the same letters with subscript M for Mumford's inequality.
I restored this idea on page 2, so maybe it makes a little bit more sense now.

p30 l5: fixed (p32 l5)

p32 l-4: yes, now stated explicitly (p34 l-4)

p33 l7: right, changed to "sous-variété" (p35 l7)

p33 l17: reference added (p35 l17)

p38 l9: C' is a shorcut for C'_D; added a reminder (p40 l7)
stated r = \deg R too (p40 l12)

p40, eq 2.27: changed "la forme" to "la famille de formes" just before the
equation, to make it clear(er) it is an equality of vectors (whose components
are polynomials) (p42 eq 2.27)

p41 l5: changed that to "qui sera choisi assez grand" (p43 l5)

p42 l5: right, linearity is used at the middle of the proof actually. I
changed the proof to make it explicit (p44 l11 to l18).

p45 l7: reference added (p46 l17), changed Hilbert to Hibert-Samuel too (3x)

p47 l8-10: right, fixed (p49 l14-16)

p48 l1: fixed (p50 l7)

p48 l6: I chose to add a footnote here (p50 l12) and a reminder (again as a
footnote, refering to the first footnote) when the first forward reference is
made in section 2.4.2 (p66, ref to 2.65) and section 2.5 (p73, ref to 2.62)

p49 l9: right (p51 l14)

----- BEGIN new p/l numbers need updating -----

p53 l-6 and -5: removed them, there presence was a mistake.

p57 l1: that's not what I really meant, corrected (p56 l-6 now).

p59 l-10: note means footnote here; removed the superflous instance.

p80 l11&12: done, p79 l-4 & -5 now.

p96 l-8: done.

p96 l-1: done.

p97 l13: fixed.

p97 l11: fixed by adapting the result (which is meant to be used with the
normalized height in (3.16)).

p97 l-7 & l-4: done.

p102 l12&13: done.

p102 l-2: ok.

p103 l9: removed this sentence (it belonged to a previous version of the
lemma).

p114 l8: you're right, in general it doesn't. I modified these paragraphs. Now
I only state that *in some particular cases* it does imply what I said, and
also add some heuristic comments regarding the general case.

p115 l-5: an argument was missing from my proof, however in the case
considered here, I believe the result was correct, see the corrected argument.

p132: fixed.
