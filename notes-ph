Warning: page and line numbers at the start of a line (before the colon) are
references to the original list; page and line numbers in the replies (after
the colon), however, refer to the *new* version of the manuscript!

Also, the revised version includes corrections and improvments suggested by
the other reviewer too.

p10 l-4: see p12 l1 to l5.

p11 l11: done.

p11 l-1: see p12 l3.

p16 l-11: added a definition (now p17 l19).

p16 l-3: Oops, you're right, using \inf now. I adapted the proofs of lemme
3.4.1 and lemme 4.1.3; I believe no other proofs are impacted.

p17 l5: it is. Now stated explicitly (p17 l-1)

p17 l12: done (p18 l7)

p19 l-1: added a reference (the line before prop 1.6.3, p20 now)

p21 l18: it is, fixed the notation (p22 l18 now)

p22 l12: the constants are computed just below (added a sentence about that
hoping to make it clearer, now p23 l11).

----- BEGIN new p/l numbers need updating -----

p25 l8: I tend to disagree. Theorem 2.1.1 is trivial if \eps \ge 1, as
observed on p26 l7-9. Corollaires 2.7.6 and 2.7.9 are correct for any \eps
since Theorem 2.1.1 is. Or did I miss something?

p25 l10: in general, x_i means any point, while e_i means the points
contradicting theorem 2.1.1 that are fixed from section 2.2 to section 2.6
included, to distinguish them from random points denoted by x_i (eg at the
beginning of section 2.2.5).

p25 l16: the subscript V is meant as a reference to Vojta (to be really
nitpicky, it's an upright V, while the variety is an italic V). Originally the
idea was to have the same letters with subscript M for Mumford's inequality.
I restored this idea on page 2, so maybe it makes a little bit more sense now.

p53 l-6 and -5: removed them, there presence was a mistake.

p57 l1: that's not what I really meant, corrected (p56 l-6 now).

p59 l-10: note means footnote here; removed the superflous instance.

p80 l11&12: done, p79 l-4 & -5 now.

p96 l-8: done.

p96 l-1: done.

p97 l13: fixed.

p97 l11: fixed by adapting the result (which is meant to be used with the
normalized height in (3.16)).

p97 l-7 & l-4: done.

p102 l12&13: done.

p102 l-2: ok.

p103 l9: removed this sentence (it belonged to a previous version of the
lemma).

p114 l8: you're right, in general it doesn't. I modified these paragraphs. Now
I only state that *in some particular cases* it does imply what I said, and
also add some heuristic comments regarding the general case.

p115 l-5: an argument was missing from my proof, however in the case
considered here, I believe the result was correct, see the corrected argument.

p132: fixed.
